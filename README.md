## Setup Local Environment
In the base folder (/broacast-social-media), run `npm install` to install all external dependencies needed.<br>
> <b>This needs to be ran before you are able to run the code</b>

## Run the Code

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Any changes to the code will refresh this server with the updated changes

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. <br>
><b>This will be automatically ran on `ng serve`. You do not need to run this, github will automatically run `ng build` and deploy to public server. Those deploy scripts are found in `.github/workflows` folder and are created by Google Firebase</b>

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). This will open up an external window with test results.<br>
><b>To close the window, `Ctrl + C` on the terminal you used to run the test</b>
