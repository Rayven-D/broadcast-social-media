>>>Setup Local Environment
In the base folder (/broacast-social-media), run npm install to install all external dependencies needed.
This needs to be ran before you are able to run the code

>>>Run the Code
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Any changes to the code will refresh this server with the updated changes

>>>Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.
This will be automatically ran on ng serve. You do not need to run this, github will automatically run ng build and deploy to public server. Those deploy scripts are found in .github/workflows folder and are created by Google Firebase

>>>Running unit tests
Run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma. This will open up an external window with test results.
To close the window, Ctrl + C on the terminal you used to run the test
